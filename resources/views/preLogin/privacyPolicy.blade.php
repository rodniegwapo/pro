        <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
        <p>nProHub Holdings Inc. (“nProHub”) collects certain information through its websites located at www.nProHub.com and related mobile sites and consumer mobile applications, (collectively, “Sites”). Your privacy is important to nProHub and this Privacy Policy lays out nProHub’s policies and procedures surrounding the collection and handling of such information. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Sites. As used herein, the term “Restaurant” refers to any nProHub partner, including restaurants, grocery providers, beverage services, and other such business from whom User may order using the nProHub app or website. This Privacy Policy applies only to the Sites. It does not apply to any restaurant websites, other third party services linked to nProHub Sites or offline activities related to nProHub services.</p>
        <div class="sml-bx">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information nProHub Collects</strong> – nProHub may collect the following information from users of our Sites: first name, last name, street address, city, state, zip code, cross streets (optional), phone number, email address, Sites-specific display name, GPS location (mobile and web), electronic signature and credit card information (nProHub stores only last four digits) (collectively, “Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”). nProHub is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and nProHub does not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 13. Use of the Sites requires that you register and/or create an account (“Account”) or use the Sites as a guest. In addition to the PII set forth above, nProHub may collect information regarding Account holders’ nProHub orders, gratuity amounts, favorite restaurants, favorite items, customer service inquiries, service/restaurant reviews, and certain social networking preferences relating to the Sites (e.g. pages or entities you like, recommend or follow). nProHub also collects aggregated information, demographic information and other information that does not reveal your specific identity (“Non-PII”). Non-PII may include information about the device you use to access the Sites, information from referring websites and your engagement with the Sites. nProHub may publish these statistics or share them with third parties without including PII. nProHub uses HTTPS cookies to collect information about you and your activity on the Sites. nProHub uses this information to remember users on the Sites and to enhance users’ experience on the Sites. For example, when users with nProHub Accounts return to the Sites, cookies identify those users and allow the Sites to provide certain user-specific information such as nProHub account information, past orders, favorite restaurants, items, and user restaurant reviews. To learn more about cookies, visit www.AllAboutCookies.org. nProHub also works with third parties for the purpose of advertisement delivery on the Sites. The Non-PII collected about your visits to the Sites may be used by third parties in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These third parties may also set cookies to assist with advertisement delivery services. To learn more about opting-out of cookie-targeted advertising on the Sites (sometimes referred to as online behavioral advertising or OBA), visit www.AboutAds.info. Some browsers allow you to indicate that you would not like your online activities tracked, using “Do Not Track” indicators (“DNT Indicators”), however, we are not obligated to respond to these indicators. Presently, we are not set up to respond to DNT Indicators. This means that while the Sites may track certain latent information about your online activities, the collected information will be used to improve your use of our Site and in ways consistent with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.</li>

                <li><strong>nProHub’s Use Of Collected Information</strong> – nProHub uses PII to create users’ nProHub Accounts, to communicate with users (directly and through restaurants and delivery drivers) about nProHub services, offer users additional services, assist with Customer service inquiries, offer promotions and special offers, charge for purchases and gratuities made through nProHub and fulfill nProHub orders. Users may opt to allow nProHub to store certain PII used to create users’ nProHub Accounts, including, but not limited to, credit card information (last four digits only). nProHub uses certain stored PII to customize future order processing for you. You may request that nProHub cease storing certain PII at any time, but you might not be able to take advantage of certain customized features. Users may affirmatively opt-out of receiving promotional communications from nProHub by contacting support@nProHub.com and providing nProHub with their e-mail address. nProHub may also use PII to enforce nProHub Terms of Use.</li>

                <li>nProHub does not sell the information it collects through the Sites to third parties. nProHub shares collected PII with restaurants and delivery drivers only to the extent required to fulfill nProHub orders. nProHub also shares collected PII with third-party vendors and service providers with whom nProHub works to provide application programming interfaces (“APIs”) and other functions for the Sites in connection with the delivery of nProHub services only to the extent necessary to provide those APIs and services. Full credit card numbers are transmitted to nProHub’s credit card processor but are not stored by nProHub. nProHub allows certain social media platforms to host plug-ins or widgets on the Sites which may collect certain information about those users who choose to use those plugins or widgets. nProHub may also disclose PII to third parties such as attorneys, collection agencies, tribunals or law enforcement authorities pursuant to valid requests in connection with alleged violations of nProHub terms of use and service or other alleged contract violations, infringement or similar harm to persons or property. Additionally, If another company acquires, or plans to acquire, nProHub, its business or its assets, nProHub will also share information including PII with that company, including at the negotiation stage.</li>

                <li>User generated content posted through the Sites such as service/restaurant reviews and certain social networking preferences (e.g. pages you “Like” or “Follow”) may be viewed by the general public. Accordingly, nProHub cannot ensure the privacy of any PII included in such user generated content.</li>

                <li><strong>nProHub’s Protection of PII</strong> – nProHub uses reasonable security measures equal to or exceeding industry standard to protect PII from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification and disclosure. Unfortunately, even with these measures, nProHub cannot guarantee the security of PII. By using the Sites, you acknowledge and agree that nProHub makes no such guarantee, and that you use the Sites at your own risk. </li>
