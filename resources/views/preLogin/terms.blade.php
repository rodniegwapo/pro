User understands that the Service may not be error free, and use may be interrupted.</li>

                <li>The app, the sites, (hereinafter used interchangeably) the materials and all other content on the app and sites are provided “as is” and without warranties of any kind, either express or implied.

                <li>User MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS UNDER STATE LAW, so the above DISCLAIMERS may not apply to User.</li>

All cancellation requests outside of that time period are at nProHub/Bite Squad’s discretion based on order status. Once the restaurant has begun to prepare your order, it cannot be cancelled.</li>
